## [When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)
This article highlights the shift between the popularity of computers amongst women and men over the time period of ~1965 - 2015ish.
It describes the cultural shift and theorizes the reason why the tech industry is a male dominated industry.

### Questions

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- Home computers became available during 1980s and a cultural shift emerged with a narrative that computers were primarily toys for boys.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- It created a narrative that males developed computer skills as a child so as an adult, they already possessed the requisite skills to be sucessful in a computer/tech field.

## [Why Diversity Matters to You and Your Company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)
Diversity matters. When driven by business leaders, it will lead to better performing teams and more succesfull companies. And it's also the right thing to do as a good human being.


### Questions

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
- When company leaders make it a leading priority to foster an environment that continuously promotes diversity and inclusion
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative, perform better, and can serve a larger and more diverse user base.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- In the article, there's an example of how an application was built for primarily right-handed users which caused accessibility issues for left-handed users. If there was a left-handed user on the development team, then perhaps that user base may have been included in the development process and the release of the application would have included a feature for left-handed users.
