# Class 01 - Intro to React and Components

## [Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
CBA emphasizes creating modular, reuseable and independent components with well-defined interfaces. These components can be assembled and integrated to build complex systems, promoting modularity, scalability and ease of maintenance.

### Questions

1. What is a “component”?
- A software object that is modular, portable, replaceable and reuseable. It has a set of well-defined functionality and is meant to interact with other components to represent a certain or set of functionalities.
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
- Reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated and independent.
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
- Ease of deployment, reduced cost, reusable, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent.

## [What is "Props" and how to use it in React?](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)
Props (properties) are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child component. The unidirectional flow of props supports the creation of modular and reuseable components allowing for dynamic content rendering within a React application.

### Questions

1. What is “props” short for?
- In React, "props" is short for properties.
2. How are props used in React?
- It's a way to pass data and communicate information from a parent component to a child component.
3. What is the flow of props?
- Props follows a unidirectional flow where data is passed from parent to child but not the other way around.
