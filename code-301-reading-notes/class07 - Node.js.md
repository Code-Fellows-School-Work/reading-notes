# Class 07 - Node.js

## [Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine, enabling the execution of JavaScript code on the server side. Known for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, Node.js is particularly well-suited for building scalable and real-time applications. Its lightweight nature, large ecosystem of npm packages, and versatility make it a popular choice for web server development, API creation, and various other backend tasks. - ChatGPT

## [Six Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
Pair programming is a software development practice where two dev pair together to write code. One dev is assigned the driver and is responsible for coding and the other dev is the navigator and is responsible for guiding the driver.

### Questions

- Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from others, develops social skills, helps prepare for job interview readiness and work environment readiness skills
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- Learning from others because it's an opportunity to help fill in some knowledge gaps by asking and discussing code with others
3. How does pair programming work?
- One person is a driver and is responsible for coding and the other person is a navigator and is responsible for guiding the driver, but is not physically coding
