## [SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
Two types of databases are SQL and NoSQL.

Differences between SQL and NoSQL:
1. SQL databases are primarily called Realational Databases (RDBMS) vs NoSQL database are called non-relational or distributed database
2. SQL databases are table based whereas NoSQL are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores
3. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL have dynamic schema for unstructured data
4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
5. SQL databases uses SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating data whereas queries in NoSQL databases are focused on collection of documents

### Questions

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Structured data organized in a table format
2. Give a real world example.
Contacts database containing First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, etc.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Unstructured data that is document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
4. Give a real world example.
Storing and/or updating key-value pairs like user name and password 
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
Depends on the preferred method for scalability. SQL databases can be scaled by increasing CPU, RAM and SSD whereas NoSQL can be scaled by increasing server size

Understanding error messages is critical to debugging code. Try to remove all errors prior to acp.

### Questions

1. What is a ‘reference error’?
- Try to use a variable that has not been declared
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
- Something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax (common syntax errors: missing commas or semi-colons)
3. What is a ‘range error’?
- Manipulating an object or array with an invalid length
(common range error: array with a length of -1)
4. What is a ‘type error’?
- The data type being used is incomptaible
5. What is a breakpoint?
- It's a debugging tool that adds a stopping point in your code to help devs debug
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
Adding debugger will show all the running code up to the debugger statement which is helpful for troubleshooting code.
