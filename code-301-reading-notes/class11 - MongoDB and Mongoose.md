# Class 11 - MongoDB and Mongoose

## [SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
Two types of databases are SQL and NoSQL.

Differences between SQL and NoSQL:
1. SQL databases are primarily called Realational Databases (RDBMS) vs NoSQL database are called non-relational or distributed database
2. SQL databases are table based whereas NoSQL are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores
3. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL have dynamic schema for unstructured data
4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
5. SQL databases uses SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating data whereas queries in NoSQL databases are focused on collection of documents

### Questions

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Structured data organized in a table format
2. Give a real world example.
Contacts database containing First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, etc.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Unstructured data that is document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
4. Give a real world example.
Storing and/or updating key-value pairs like user name and password 
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
Depends on the preferred method for scalability. SQL databases can be scaled by increasing CPU, RAM and SSD whereas NoSQL can be scaled by increasing server size

### Questions

1. What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
Database which works with certain assumptions and supports structured query language
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Uses tables
4. What is a ‘schema’?
A format requirement for storing data
5. What is a NoSQL database?
Database that does not use a tabular format like SQL and handles unstructured data
6. How does it work?
No or few relations and can access and manipulate unstructured data
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
Collections, documents, key-value pairs
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB because of it's schema-less requirement allowing to add or remove data from data fields
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Because of no schema, that means the data can be less standarized
