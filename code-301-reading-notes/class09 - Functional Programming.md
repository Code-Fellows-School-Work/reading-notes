### Questions

1. What is a module?
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

## Things I want to know more about
- I think it's pretty cool to understand the background behind the words used for a URL and how it navigates to the correct resource
- The reading says get, post, put, patch and delete are the most common RESTful web APIs, but what are the uncommon ones?
- Future features for city-explorer will incorporate more APIs. I'm assuming we'll have to figure out a way to use asynchronous operations to ensure all the data renders at the same time to optimize the user experience.
- What are best practices to ensure our web APIs are not "chatty"?
