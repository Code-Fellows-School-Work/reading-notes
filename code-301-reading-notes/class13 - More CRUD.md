### Questions

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
- Create = Post
- Read = Get
- Update = Put
- Delete = Delete
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Create server and bring in all dependencies and middleware
- Identify names of endpoints
- Match endpoints with REST methods
- Determine the schema
- Implement security measures for API

## Things I want to know more about
- How do I get my hands on a server template that contains all the middleware, dependencies, etc so I can just plug in information like a madlib? Seeing that was incredibly cool
- I need to figure out all those coding shortcuts like coping several lines of code and pasting using only the keyboard.
