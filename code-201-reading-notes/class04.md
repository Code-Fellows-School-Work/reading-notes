## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
- A software development practice where two developers work on one code. Several benefits include an additional set of eyes to catch code errors, increased collboration, allows an opportunity for a less-seasoned programmer to be mentored by a seasoned-programmer, helps develop social, interpersonal skills, and teamwork skills.

### Questions
1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
- The mentorship opportunity while pair programming would be advantageous for me because pairing with a seasoned-programmer would essentially be a guide to help me write and understand code. Additionally, I would get a better sense of working in a software development environment and I'll have a better understand of the industry prior to working in it.
