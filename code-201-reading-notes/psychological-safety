- Studies have shown it's difficult to determine the best composition of a team
- However, reasearch suggests a good team fosters a work culture that exercises team norms that are best suited for the team members
- A norm that enables proportional group discussion was typically viewed as a successful team quality and leads to a positive impact on achieving end results

### Questions

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- Open communication amongst team members, treating others with trust and respect and the willingness to understand with using empathy
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
- While in the Navy, I often worked with team members that were also my friends after hours. We often joked about weekend plans and gossip about fun and exciting things, but when it came to our daily tasks and responsibilities, we put the light-hearted jokes aside and shifted into results-driven leaders. It was a tough job with demanding hours, but our ability to openly communicate issues and trust with one another enabled us to operate as an efficient organization while keeping it light and fun.
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
- Increased creativity, better results, and higher job-satisfaction.

## Things I want to know more about
- Teams that incorporate AI into their everyday workflow, how does that affect team norms and psychological safety? AI doesn't operate with empathy but what if it did? Is AI considered part of the team or just a tool to assist members that are part of the team?
