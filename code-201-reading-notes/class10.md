# Class 10 - Debugging

## [Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)
- Syntax error: spelling errors in code
- Logic error: Program runs but produces incorrect results
- Error message - "... is not a function" means JavaScript does not recognize the function probably because of a syntax error
- Error message - "can't access property "textContent", then use console.log following the line after the line of code that is producing the error and review what variable is being referenced
- Using console.log can also help troubleshoot a logic error
- [JavaScript Error Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors)

### Questions
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
- A syntax error means JavaScript does not understand the line of code typically from a spelling error and logic error means the code runs but does not produce the intended results
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- I've seen the "... is not a function" before and "can't access property" but instead of using the developer tools recommended in this reading, I referred to ChatGPT to identify the erorrs in my code.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
- This will be helpful in making debugging more efficient and less painful. Understanding what capabilities of these debugging tools with help reduce the amount of time troubleshooting code and will help with project completion

## [Browser Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)


### Questions
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
3. What is the call stack?
