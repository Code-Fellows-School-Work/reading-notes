### Answer
What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

What do the following commands do?

1. pwd (print working directory) states the current directory terminal is working in
2. ls - lists all the contents within that directory
3. cd - change directory (used to move to another directory)
4. mkdir - make directory (creates new directory)
5. touch - make a file (file needs to include .filetype)

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

1. cd projects - changes the current directory to the directory named projects
2. mkdir new-project - creates a new directory called new-project
3. touch new-project/newfile.md - creates a markdown file named newfile within the new-project folder
4. cd .. - goes back two directories
5. ls projects/new-project - lists all the contents within the projects/new-project folder
