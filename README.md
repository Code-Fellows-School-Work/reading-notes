## Introduction

Hello! My name is Errol Vidad - I am a US Navy veteran and I'm pivoting into the tech industry. I am somewhat familiar with markdown from my last job as an information systems analyst and I'm looking forward to improving my current coding skills and eventually specializing in python. My interests include &#x1F3C8;&#x1F3C2;&#x2744;

This is an online repository to document my journey to become a software developer.
