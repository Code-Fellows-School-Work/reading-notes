# Class 8 Notes - Operators and Loops

Expressions and operators
- Expressions are codes that resolve value
    - Either by assigning value or evaluating value

Loops and iteration
- Loops do something repeatedly
- For loops execute until a condition is false (executes a finite amount of times)
    - ex. removing a finite amount of dishes from the dishwasher
- While loops execute until a condition is true (executes an undefined amount of time)
    - ex. guessing my password until it's correct

1. What is an expression in JavaScript? - experession can either assign a value or evaluate an expression
2. Why would we use a loop in our code? - a loop can be used to repeat a command multiple times
3. When does a for loop stop executing? - will continue until a condition is evaluated as false
4. How many times will a while loop execute? - will continue until a condition is evaluated as true
