# Class 4 Notes - Structure Webpages for HTML

## What is wireframe?

Practice used by UX designers to define and plan information for a website, app, or product.
- Process focuses on designers intended method for users to process information
- Defines OMI process
- Allows programers to plan the layout and interaction of the interface without extra bloat

Practices for beginners:
- Use paper & pencil or whiteboard 
- Use prototypes
- When ready, switch to software to help track changes

## 6 steps to wireframe:

1. Do research - analyze intended audience, collect requirements, create user personas, define use cases, benchmark with competition
2. Create quick reference cheat sheet to remind yourself of important design points or requirements
3. Map user flow and determine each user personas begin and end state
4. Draft a rough sketch before commiting to code
5. Develop method to test your ideas with team mebmers
6. Develop wireframe into prototypes

## 3 principles for good wireframe:

1. Clarity - website needs to answer what the user can do there
2. Confidence - users need ability to easily navigate
3. Simplicity - do not include bloat

## What is HTML?:

Markup language that defines structure of content.
- Uses <i>elements</i> to enclose content to appear a certain way.
- Components of an HTML element
    1. Opening tag
    2. Closing tag
    3. Content
    4. Attributes of the tag
    5. Element (all 1, 2, 3)

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to show in the actual content.

Attributes that set a value always have:
- A space between it and the element name
- The attribute name followed be an equal sign
- Attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks

Nesting elements allows to put elements within elements
- ex. using paragraph element and bold element within same code
    - <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

## Anatomy of HTML

Elements of HTML
1. doc type
2. html brackets
3. head element
4. meta name
5. title element
6. body element 

## Adding misc to HTML

* <img> element - use SRC
* <> h1 - h6 - adds headings
* <> ul - unordered list
* <> ol - ordered list
* <> li - puts contents within list
* <> a - adds list to website (anchor)

# Semantics

Def: Meaning of a piece of code (what effect does this code have)

Purpose: HTML semantics takes the contents and gives a label to that content

ex. 
- Justic League (header)
- Team of superheros appearing in DC comics (paragraph)
- Members (subheading)
- Batman, Wonderwoman, Superman (list items)
