## [How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
- Random module provides access to functions to generate random numbers and strings
- ```randit()```: generate a random integer between the two arguments
- ```random()```: generate a random float between 0 an 1 (no arguments)
- ```choice()```: select a random element from a collection object and takes in a list, set, tuple, etc as an argument
- ```shuffle()```: shuffles the elements in the list and accepts a list as an argument
    - do not assign shuffle to a variable
- ```randrange()```: select a random elements from a given range.
    - takes three numbers as arguments for start, stop and step

## [What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)
- In the context of software development, risk analysis is the process of identifying risks then prioritizing completion of each risk based on risk severity and impact to the project
- Steps to perform risk analysis:
    - Identify risk
    - Analyze impact to risk
    - Implement measures to mitigate risk

## [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)
- Fixtures enables sharing data across multiple tests
- Coverage shows how much of the code was run through the tests

### Questions

1. How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?
    - The random module includes several functions that will select a random number or element within a list.
    - Common functions available include: ```randit()```, ```random()```, ```choice()```, ```shuffle()```, ```randrange()```

2. In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
- Risk analysis is the process of identifying risks, assessing each risk, and implementing measures to mitigate risk
- Steps to conduct risk analysis:
    1. Identify risks
    2. Analyze risks
    3. Mitigate risks

3. What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?

4. What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
