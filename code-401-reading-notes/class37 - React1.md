## Reading Questions

### After reading "Tailwind in 15 minutes", can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

    - Tailwind CSS enables utility classes to style a webpage directly from HTML markup allowing for rapid development without the need to use custom class-based CSS

- Example from ChatGPT
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded shadow">
  Click me
</button>
```
    - bg-blue-500: Applies a blue background color.
    - text-white: Sets the text color to white.
    - py-2: Applies padding on the top and bottom (y-axis) of the button.
    - px-4: Applies padding on the left and right (x-axis) of the button.
    - rounded: Adds rounded corners to the button.
    - shadow: Applies a box-shadow for a subtle lift effect.

### Based on "Why to use Next.js," explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js's server-side rendering approach.

    - Next.js provides server-rendered React applications as opposed to the traditional client-side rendered application 
    - Next.js's enables increased webpage performance, load only required code versus the entire webpage, built in support for CSS and Sass, and near-zero configuration designed to work out of the box

## Things I want to know more about

- I saw an article that their was a big update to React a few days ago - how does that update impact Next.js and other React-based frameworks?
