## Reading Questions

### What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the "Whiteboard Advice" reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

    - Restate the question to include input and outputs to confirm understanding of the problem domain
    - Discuss about edge cases
    - Ask for a sample test cases and think of other test cases
    - Write the algorithm in plain english or psuedo code. Engage in a discussion with the interviewer and nudge them for hints and understanding
    - Write the algorithm in code. If you forget a method or syntax, ask the interviewer - they shouldn't give you grief but if they do, leave in psuedo code then come back later.
    - Ask for help if you're stuck

### From the "6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview" article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

    - Don't sweat the small stuff: I typically get hung up when I don't remember the method name or proper syntax but it's okay to not remember. Be honest with the interviewer you don't know, come up with an alternative, and explain you'll look it up later
    - Remember demonstrating soft skills:
        - Communicate ideas clearly and effectively
        - Treat interviewer with respect
        - Openess to feedback
        - Openess to collaboration
        - Forthcoming about ambiguity or misunderstanding

### What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

- Interview questions are designed to be challenging because that's the best way to measure your problem-solving skills
- It's fair game for an interviewer to ask a problem domain that is a frequent occurence in their software role
- Biggest hurdle is imposter syndrome and going into a problem already thinking it's not solvable by the candidate -- be resilient and adaptable
