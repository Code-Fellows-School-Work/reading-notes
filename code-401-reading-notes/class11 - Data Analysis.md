# Class 11 - Data Analysis

## [Get Started - JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

- Jupyterlab integrates Jupyter Notebooks with built-in tools such as text editors, code consoles and terminals, common formats

## [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

- Numerical Python: commonly used data analysis package

### Questions

1. What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

- Jupyterlab integrates Jupyter Notebooks with built-in tools such as text editors, code consoles and terminals, common formats.
- It differs from Jupyter Notebook because of its ability to open multiple documents simultaneously and a team-work feature enabling real-time project collaboration

2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

- Numerical Python - commonly used data analysis package
- Include numerous functions and methods to manipulate and transform data
- Manipulate data stored in N-dimensional arrays
- Operations to convert between data types
- Includes mathematical and comparison operators
    - Include trigonometry and linear algebra functions

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

- Elements within the NumPy array need to be of the same data type, they can represent multiple dimensions (1D, 2D, N-D), and the size of the array cannot be changed after created
- Manipulating NumPy arrays are similar to performing manipulation operations to lists
- Use methods like index, slice, concatenate, split
- Use mathematical or comparison operations to transform or compare data

## Things I want to know more about
- What are some other data analysis libraries and how do they integrate with NumPy?
