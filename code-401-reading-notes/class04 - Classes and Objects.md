# Class 04 - Classes & Objects

## [Classes & Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
- Objects encapsulate variables and functions
- Classes are templates for objects
- To access the variables and functions within a class, you need to:
    - create a Class and assign it to a variable.
    - Access the properties and methods of that Class by using dot notation
    <pre>
    <code>
    class MyClass:
        variable = "blah"    
        def function(self):
            print("This is a message inside the class.")

    myobjectx = MyClass()

    print(myobjectx.variable)
    </code>
    </pre>

## [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
- Recursive (in other words): taking a big problems and breaking it down into smaller problems
- Recursive (in Python): a function that calls itself and repeats its behavior until a condition is met and a result is returned
- Keep in mind that state needs to be maintained either through the recursive call or through a global variable


## [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)
- Fixtures enables sharing data across multiple tests
- Coverage shows how much of the code was run through the tests

### Questions
1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
- Objects encapsulate variables and functions and classes are templates for objects. To create an instance of that class, use dot notation 

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
- When you take a large problem and break it down into smaller problems that are repeatable. Continue to do these repeatable small problems until a specific result is obtained. 
- Best practices:
    - Ensure there's a base case to avoid a stack overflow
    - Ensure state is being managed either in the recursion or as a global variable

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
- Fixtures help make TDD efficient by sharing data across tests and code coverage helps inform how much of the code was ran through the tests. Fixtures can help reduce duplicate test code and coverage helps ensures there's no gaps in the code that was tested which may lead to unexpected bugs

## Things I want to know more about
What is __init__ and how do I know when to use it?
