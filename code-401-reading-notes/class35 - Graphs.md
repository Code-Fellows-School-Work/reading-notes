### Questions

1. A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of ____ potentially connected by line segments named edges.
2. The degree of a vertex is defined as the number of ____ connected to that vertex.
3. An ____ Graph is a type of graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional, meaning there is no direction to the flow.
4. A Directed Graph, also known as a ____, has edges with specific directions indicating the flow from one vertex to another.
5. A ____ graph is one where all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
6. A ____ graph is characterized by some vertices not having edges.
7. An acyclic graph is a directed graph without ____, meaning there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
8. The most common ways to represent graphs are through Adjacency ____ and Adjacency ____.
9. In a weighted graph, edges have ____ assigned to them.
10. In the context of graph traversal algorithms, BFS utilizes a ____ data structure to explore nodes level by level, ensuring that all nodes at a certain distance from the source are explored before moving on to nodes at a greater distance. Conversely, the DFS employs a ____ data structure, allowing it to dive as deep as possible into one branch before backtracking to explore new branches.
