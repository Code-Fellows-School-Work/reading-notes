### Questions

1. A __________ is the result of an algorithm converting an incoming string into a value for determining the index of an array in a hashtable.

2. Each index of a hashtable array is known as a __________, which can contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

3. Hashtables are used to hold unique values, act as a __________, and serve as a library among other uses.

4. The ability to encode a key that maps to a specific location for quick value retrieval in a hashtable is known as a __________.

5. True or False: The reason why searching for a piece of data in a collection is O(N) isn’t because the array is slow, but because we have to look through all N things in the collection.

6. The process of turning a key into a numeric value for index placement in a hashtable involves a __________ algorithm.

7. When two different keys hash to the same index in an array, it's known as a __________.

8. True or False: A perfect hash function in a hashtable guarantees that collisions will never occur.

9. To handle collisions, a __________ can be initialized in each bucket of a hashtable allowing multiple key/value pairs to be stored at the same index.

10. The __________ method in a hashtable takes a key, calculates its hash, and uses modulus to convert the hash into an array index for storing the key/value pair.
