## [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)
- Apply deliberate practice in coding by focusing on weak areas or pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone
- If you build something that you're already familiar with, then you're not applying deliberate practice
- Other aspects of deliberate practice include: continuous feedback, repeated often, and is difficult.
- Personal goal setting for skill improvement is important because only you best understand your skillset

## [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)
- Reframe failures to "not yet" and instead of avoiding those challenges, seek ways to improve to "yet" or "success"
- Reward yourself for the process to help build resiliency and perseverance 

## [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)
- Having the power of grit and perseverance is one of the best predictors of success
- Apply this lesson when learning new coding topics and also the eventual job interview process 
- This process is a marathon and not a sprint. Keep in mind the endurance and stamina required to meet the end-goal

## [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)
- What is success? Have I personally defined what success looks like to me or is my version of success influenced by other's view of success
- We're in the driver's seat for our own success
- Focus on my own idea of success instead of being influenced by others on what success is

## Emotional Intelligence Summary
I don't remember what my exact scores were last time I took this survey, however I do know that I scored below 18 in all areas. This time, I scored exactly 16 in every area so still below the 18 threshold. Without having the numbers from my previous survey, I think I may have improved taking it the second time. I felt like some of the questions were more relatable because I remember experincing that emotional event during the 301-course. These sort of surveys are challenging because it's hard for me to accurately assess myself but I understand it's an important skill to learn and I hope it's something I can work on during the upcoming 401-course.

## Assessing Bias Summary
- My strongest area is defining bias and identifying it's impact to oneself and others. 
- My weakest areas are empathy and acting on bias. I think this is a personal challenege I need to overcome because I'm a non-confrontational person and that in itself may cause issues in the long-run within the organization or even my personal development. I'm hoping this is an area I can grow in during the upcoming course.
- In addition to challenge being con-confrontational, I need to work on breaking out of my comfort zone. Within a couple months, this class will end and my ultimate goal is to land a software dev job and I can't do that if I don't go out to network and meet people. I'm hoping some of the guidance from this class will help make that process easier for me and I'm genuinely excited to socialize and learn about upcoming job opportunities.

### Thing I want to know more about
- No questions, just looking forward to practicing these lessons during the upcoming course.
